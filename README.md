TENJIKU: A Community-Governed ERC-20 Token on the Polygon Blockchain
Abstract
TENJIKU ($TJC) is a community-focused, deflationary ERC-20 token built on the Polygon Blockchain. It is designed to be the foundational asset for a decentralized ecosystem, providing a secure and versatile medium for value transfer, governance, and utility. By leveraging Polygon's low-cost and high-speed infrastructure, TENJIKU ($TJC) aims to facilitate a new era of decentralized applications (dApps) and community-driven initiatives.
1. Introduction
The current blockchain landscape faces challenges related to scalability, high transaction fees, and limited community participation. Many projects struggle to balance technological innovation with true decentralization and user accessibility. TENJIKU ($TJC) was created to address these issues by providing a secure, efficient, and community-centric token that empowers its holders. Our goal is to build a robust ecosystem where token holders have a voice in the project's future.
2. Technology & Infrastructure
TENJIKU ($TJC) is deployed on the Polygon Blockchain, an L2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This choice provides several key advantages:

Low Transaction Fees: Polygon's architecture drastically reduces gas fees, making transactions affordable for all users.


High Throughput: The network can handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), ensuring fast and reliable transfers.


Ethereum Compatibility: As an EVM-compatible token, TENJIKU seamlessly integrates with the vast Ethereum ecosystem, including popular wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols.

The smart contract for TENJIKU is built using the OpenZeppelin Upgradable library. This allows for future, secure upgrades to the contract's logic, ensuring the project can adapt and evolve without migrating the token.
3. Tokenomics & Utility
TENJIKU ($TJC) is designed with a deflationary model to reward long-term holders.

Burning Mechanism: TENJIKU ($TJC) contract includes a burning function. Tokens may be burned periodically or based on certain events to permanently reduce the total supply, increasing scarcity and value.
